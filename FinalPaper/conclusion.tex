\section{Conclusion}
Our project has demonstrated the need for the study and creation of a better, more usable Encryption Domain Specific Language. Through our background research we have seen that there still remains significant room for the construction of DSL's that can accomplish high level security goals, while still enabling low level software and hardware development. As we proposed, many issues exist with generic programming languages. Through our implementation of RC4 in Java, C, LISP, and Python, we've shown that each language has specific vulnerabilities or innate hindrances when developing a cryptographic algorithm. With Cryptol, ease of use is the concern. While it provides verifiable security, it's unusual syntax and structure make it dificult to use in production environment. There is ample room for this project to continue, and we look forward to further exploration of the topic.
